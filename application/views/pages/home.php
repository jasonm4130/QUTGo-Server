	<h2>What is QUT Go</h2>
	<p>QUT Go is an app developed by Venom Technologies as a final year IT capstone project. It allows students and
		staff studying at the QUT gardens point campus to sign up for an account using their Google accounts. They can then
		add friends, issue walking challenges or be challenged to walk more throughout the day.</p>
	<p>The main goal of qut go is to help people live a healthier lifestyle. The app achieves this for staff and
		students through the use of challenges. Whenever a user leaves a building within the QUT campus the app will issue
		a challenge to the user to walk to X building. This could be where they were already going, but more likely than
		not it will be a different building. By encouraging participants to walk that little extra they can accumliate more
		steps throughout their day.</p>
	<p>The app also allows others to add their friends and challenge them or organise to meet with them. Making the app
		more engaging for users.</p>
